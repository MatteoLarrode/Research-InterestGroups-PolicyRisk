# Predictive model of interest groups' behaviour in the face of policy outcome uncertainty

## Research Pitch 
<p>
We investigate the behaviour of interest groups regarding new and innovative - so-called "sunrise" - policies. Those areas of policymaking with little historical background lack scientific data to predict accurately whether policies will yield the desired results or not. This uncertainty puts interest groups who lobby for them in a conundrum: if a policy is new, innovative & salient, the group will want to remain relevant, and so will pursue the policy to resonate with their member base, even if there is little scientific information to inform the pursuit.
</p>

<p>
A perfect example of the peculiarity of 'risky' policymaking is the handling of biofuel policies in the EU. At first, environmental groups were thrilled by the prospect of the EU taking the lead on developing green energy from biofuels. This excitement led groups to lobby in favor of the directive, and to the subsequent investment of billions of euros by the EU into their production.
</p>
<p>
However, a few years later, scientists discovered that the production of biofuels, actually hurts the environment by dedicating fertile lands to biofuel production, in addition of driving up food prices. The gamble taken by the EU and many lobbying associations had proven, at best, unsuccessful, detrimental at worst.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, in the light of this new information, the EU doubled down on its efforts and increased renewable energy targets instead of changing course on bioful policy. This behaviour can be explain by the consequential amount of money already invested in the project, and by the risk of losing political capital and credibility that were at stake. This combination of factors, often observed in many areas of policymaking especially in "sunrise" industries, can lead to so-called "path dependence" and "locked-in" policies. </br>
</p>

<p>

Drawing from this example, we ask the question: **How do lobbying organizations that rely on member funding & donations to achieve their missions frame and advocate for these uncertain policy goals, or worse policy failures?**
</p>

<p>

We formulate three hypotheses as to how interest groups behave to mitigate the risk of innovative policies:
- *interest groups will lobby in coalitions to diffuse the potential blame across partners (H1)*
- *interest groups will transfer the blame to bureaucracy, and use it as fodder for future movements (H2)*
- *interest groups will outsource policy experiments to foreign nations (H3)*
</p>

<p>
This research integrates into a contemporary dynamic in the study of public policy that attributes a key role to interest groups in policy change. 
</p>
<p>
Traditional policy feedback research shows how policies reinforce themselves over time. Processes of “path dependence” explain that once a policy course is set, it is difficult to reverse. The underlying dynamic is that policies reshape politics by changing interest groups’ and individuals’ resources, identities and preferences. As mentioned above, this phenomenon has recently been observed in the case of the European Union's biofuel policies.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, policy reversals can frequently be observed. Ongoing conflicts over policy, even after some have been passed that are expected to generate feedback, suggests that the “the capacity of public policies to remake politics is contingent, conditional, and contested” (Patashnik and Zelizer, 2013, 1072). This claim reveals the limits of policy feedback theory and motivates an alternative approach to studying policy change. 
</p>

<p>

Leah Cardamore Stokes, in *Short circuiting policy: Interest groups and the battle over clean energy and climate policy in the American States*[^1], develops a framework placing interest groups at the center of policy change. Under this lens, she examines the conditionality of positive feedback and path dependence. Based on the argument that “Pressure politics is a method of short-circuiting the majority” (Schattschneider 1942, 189), she reveals the particular conditions and mechanisms through which interest groups “short circuit” policy by undermining and obscuring policy feedback[^2].

<p>

The objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of interest groups - a driving force of policymaking - regarding innovative policies. Refining frameworks explaining policy change could be a step forward in limiting friction in public policy. On the one hand, better preparation for the possibility of an inefficient policy to "lock-in" would help limit their occurence. On the other hand, promoting the reinforcement of innovative policies on areas like clean energy could secure gains made in these domains characterised by quagmires and stalemate. **Are there ways of mitigating political risks for stakeholders in these situations of uncertainty where the benefits of covering unchartered waters outweigh the costs associated with potential drawbacks?**

### The Objective: National Science Fundation Grant
This research project being carried out as a grant proposal, we must take into account the criteria of the NSF behind the attribution of grants. In this context, we must coordinate our efforts to further two objectives: 
- *Quality of the research:* the grant allows to conduct research with an already solid theoretical base. The proposal must demonstrate that the data collected thanks to the allocated grant funds would be put to good use. 
- *Salience of the issue:* the NSF prioritizes research that tackles salient issues under a novel perspective. The quality of the research conducted will be more impactful is the issue it investigates is of prime importance.


<p>
A first iteration of the proposal studied the behaviour of interest groups in advocating various immigration policies in the US, depending on their associated levels of risk. This project was unfortunately not awarded the grant. However, the new iteration has been reframed and reworked using the valuable feedback received from the NSF. First, the project turned its attention away from immigration and in the direction of energy policy. This decision has been made to align with the redefinition of the scope studied by the proposal. Indeed, for this new iteration, observations in lobbying behaviour in the face of uncertain policy outcomes are being integrated into a broader framework of policy change theory. This new framework, inspired by L.C. Stokes' qualitative research, places interest groups as its key element and would benefit from quantitative support. We are confident that this change in scope and subject would be a better fit to attract the curiosity of NSF decision-makers.

### Pilot Research
<p>
The scope of this project seeks to answer the question raised above: "Are there ways of mitigating political risks for stakeholders in these situations of uncertainty where the benefits of covering unchartered waters outweigh the costs associated with potential drawbacks?". We present the idea that interest groups are more likely to align themselves with other groups in the presence of political risk in order to mitigate the costs of pursuing policy under conditions of high uncertainty and limited information. By joining the coalition, these groups maximize their ability to claim credit for pioneering new and innovative policy solutions while limiting their responsibility if the policy should prove damaging to their cause. 
</p>
<p>
We operationalize a decision calculus that incorporates the risks associated with pursuing attractive but unchartered policy. We factor in the salience, nascence and ideological distance of the policies studied: 


</p>

<p>
To help both the problem and the model proposed, we use data on recent sustainable energy policy in the US, the risk associated with lobbying across various issue dimensions, and its impact on interest group coalitions




## Data Collection

### Clean Energy Policy in the US (2011-2022)

### Interest Groups activity in Clean Energy Policy (2011-2022)



## Regression Modelling 

### Dependent Variables: 
**First Model:** Number of groups lobbying <br/>
**Second Model:** Number of times the policy is lobbied for <br/>
**Third Model:** Money spent on lobbying <br/>

### Independent Variable: 
*Salience:* Number of times the policy was mentioned in Roper Polls
*Nascence:* First mention of the policy in Roper Polls
*Ideological Distance:* Ideological distance from interest group's main focus


## Limitations & follow-ups
The main limitation of this project is the quality and quantity of data available on interest groups behaviour, especially on the formation of coalitions. Indeed, this proposal merely gives a glimpse of how interest groups react to uncertain policy outcomes as we use proxy variables for the formation of coalitions: the number of groups lobbying, number of times the policy is lobbied for, and the money spent on lobbying, depending on the model. The aim of this grant proposal is to correct this lack of information on the key actors of policy change that are interest groups, and on their activities. Resources allocated would allow to gather data on interest groups behaviour, and to further transparency and the advancement of crucial policies in deadlocked areas.
