# Predictive model of interest groups' behaviour in the face of policy outcome uncertainty

## Research Pitch 
<p>
We investigate the behaviour of interest groups regarding new and innovative - so-called "sunrise" - policies. Those areas of policymaking with little historical background lack scientific data to predict accurately whether policies will yield the desired results or not. This uncertainty puts interest groups who lobby for them in a conundrum: if a policy is new, innovative & salient, the group will want to remain relevant, and so will pursue the policy to resonate with their member base, even if there is little scientific information to inform the pursuit.
</p>

<p>
A perfect example of the peculiarity of 'risky' policymaking is the handling of biofuel policies in the EU. At first, environmental groups were thrilled by the prospect of the EU taking the lead on developing green energy from biofuels. This excitement led groups to lobby in favor of the directive, and to the subsequent investment of billions of euros by the EU into their production.
</p>
<p>
However, a few years later, scientists discovered that the production of biofuels, actually hurts the environment by dedicating fertile lands to biofuel production, in addition of driving up food prices. The gamble taken by the EU and many lobbying associations had proven, at best, unsuccessful, detrimental at worst.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, in the light of this new information, the EU doubled down on its efforts and increased renewable energy targets instead of changing course on bioful policy. This behaviour can be explain by the consequential amount of money already invested in the project, and by the risk of losing political capital and credibility that were at stake. This combination of factors, often observed in many areas of policymaking especially in "sunrise" industries, can lead to so-called "path dependence" and "locked-in" policies. </br>
</p>

<p>

Drawing from this example, we ask the question: **How do lobbying organizations that rely on member funding & donations to achieve their missions frame and advocate for these uncertain policy goals, or worse policy failures?**
</p>

<p>

We formulate three hypotheses as to how interest groups behave to mitigate the risk of innovative policies:
- *interest groups will lobby in coalitions to diffuse the potential blame across partners (H1)*
- *interest groups will transfer the blame to bureaucracy, and use it as fodder for future movements (H2)*
- *interest groups will outsource policy experiments to foreign nations (H3)*
</p>

<p>
This research integrates into a contemporary dynamic in the study of public policy that attributes a key role to interest groups in policy change. 
</p>
<p>
Traditional policy feedback research shows how policies reinforce themselves over time. Processes of “path dependence” explain that once a policy course is set, it is difficult to reverse. The underlying dynamic is that policies reshape politics by changing interest groups’ and individuals’ resources, identities and preferences. As mentioned above, this phenomenon has recently been observed in the case of the European Union's biofuel policies.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, policy reversals can frequently be observed. Ongoing conflicts over policy, even after some have been passed that are expected to generate feedback, suggests that the “the capacity of public policies to remake politics is contingent, conditional, and contested” (Patashnik and Zelizer, 2013, 1072). This claim reveals the limits of policy feedback theory and motivates an alternative approach to studying policy change. 
</p>

<p>

Leah Cardamore Stokes, in *Short circuiting policy: Interest groups and the battle over clean energy and climate policy in the American States*[^1], develops a framework placing interest groups at the center of policy change. Under this lens, she examines the conditionality of positive feedback and path dependence. Based on the argument that “Pressure politics is a method of short-circuiting the majority” (Schattschneider 1942, 189), she reveals the particular conditions and mechanisms through which interest groups “short circuit” policy by undermining and obscuring policy feedback[^2].

<p>
The objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of interest groups - a driving force of policymaking - regarding innovative policies. Refining frameworks explaining policy change could be a step forward in limiting friction in public policy. On the one hand, better preparation for the possibility of an inefficient policy to "lock-in" would help limit their occurence. On the other hand, promoting the reinforcement of innovative policies on areas like clean energy could secure gains made in these domains characterised by quagmires and stalemate.

### The Objective: National Science Fundation Grant

A double objective:
- *Quality of the research:* the grant allows to conduct research with an already solid theoretical base. The proposal must demonstrate that the data collected thanks to the allocated grant funds would be put to good use. 
- *Salience of the issue:* the NSF prioritizes research that tackles salient issues under a novel perspective. The quality of the research conducted will be more impactful is the issue it investigates is of prime importance.

<p>
While designing the research project, we must not only
