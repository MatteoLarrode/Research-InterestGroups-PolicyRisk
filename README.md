# Predictive model of interest groups' behaviour in the face of policy outcome uncertainty

## Research Pitch 
<p>
We investigate the behaviour of interest groups regarding new and innovative - so-called "sunrise" - policies. Those areas of policymaking with little historical background lack scientific data to predict accurately whether policies will yield the desired results or not. This uncertainty puts interest groups who lobby for them in a conundrum: if a policy is new, innovative & salient, the group will want to remain relevant, and so will pursue the policy to resonate with their member base, even if there is little scientific information to inform the pursuit.
</p>

<p>
A perfect example of the peculiarity of 'risky' policymaking is the handling of biofuel policies in the EU. At first, environmental groups were thrilled by the prospect of the EU taking the lead on developing green energy from biofuels. This excitement led groups to lobby in favor of the directive, and to the subsequent investment of billions of euros by the EU into their production.
</p>
<p>
However, a few years later, scientists discovered that the production of biofuels, actually hurts the environment by dedicating fertile lands to biofuel production, in addition of driving up food prices. The gamble taken by the EU and many lobbying associations had proven, at best, unsuccessful, detrimental at worst.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, in the light of this new information, the EU doubled down on its efforts and increased renewable energy targets instead of changing course on bioful policy. This behaviour can be explain by the consequential amount of money already invested in the project, and by the risk of losing political capital and credibility that were at stake. This combination of factors, often observed in many areas of policymaking especially in "sunrise" industries, can lead to so-called "path dependence" and "locked-in" policies. </br>
</p>

<p>

Drawing from this example, we ask the question: **How do lobbying organizations that rely on member funding & donations to achieve their missions frame and advocate for these uncertain policy goals, or worse policy failures?**
</p>

<p>

We formulate three hypotheses as to how interest groups behave to mitigate the risk of innovative policies:
- *interest groups will lobby in coalitions to diffuse the potential blame across partners (H1)*
- *interest groups will transfer the blame to bureaucracy, and use it as fodder for future movements (H2)*
- *interest groups will outsource policy experiments to foreign nations (H3)*
</p>

<p>
This research integrates into a contemporary dynamic in the study of public policy that attributes a key role to interest groups in policy change.

### The Objective: National Science Fundation Grant

A double objective:
- *Quality of the research:* the grant allows to conduct research with an already solid theoretical base. The proposal must demonstrate that the data collected thanks to the allocated grant funds would be put to good use. 
- *Salience of the issue:* the NSF prioritizes research that tackles salient issues under a novel perspective. The quality of the research conducted will be more impactful is the issue it investigates is of prime importance.

## Data Collection

### Clean Energy Policy in the US (2011-2022)

### Interest Groups activity in Clean Energy Policy (2011-2022)



## Regression Modelling 

### Dependent Variables: 
**First Model:** Number of groups lobbying <br/>
**Second Model:** Number of times the policy is lobbied for <br/>
**Third Model:** Money spent on lobbying <br/>

### Independent Variable:
